 ## Cost of Property listing.

	• It is important to note that Booking.com is a commission-based platform. It means that hosts will pay a specific percentage that can range anything from 10% to 25% whenever they receive a booking through the platform. While the commission rate varies, on average, it is about 15%.
	
	• On average, Booking.com takes 15% off of the top of your charged rent for all confirmed bookings and all non-refundable reservations. That means for each apartment you rent for $100 per night, you will owe Booking.com $15. That percentage might seem high – for some perspective, Airbnb’s percentage varies depending on the fee structure hosts have chosen but the host-only fee ranges from 14% to 20%, while Vrbo charges roughly 5% – but it covers an exceptional support network with resources for both renters and property owners. It also gives you access to some amazing data and analytics options so that you can track your rental’s performance. 
	• It is also helpful to know that this commission percentage adjusts depending on the part of the world in which you are offering rentals (Booking.com offers a handy calculator within their extranet so you can know how much you will owe). In addition, Booking.com will not levy a commission on reservations for which the renter did not arrive (unless that reservation was a non-refundable booking, in which case the commission would still be applicable).

## VRBO

2.  Vrbo is a vacation rental platform that hosts and guests can use, like Airbnb. Vrbo was created in 1995 by a host looking to rent out his ski resort condo. It later became a place where hosts and homeowners could list their properties for short-term leasing. 
#### Listing of property 
	• There are 2 types of listing on Vrbo
	1. Annual Fee:  Vrbo offers an annual subscription fee of $499 that subscription customers pay. This fee covers all bookings received throughout the year.
Fee Per Booking:  The other option that hosts have is the “pay per booking” fee. Hosts pay a 5% commission fee to Vrbo for every booking they receive, as well as a 3% credit card processing fee. Each Vrbo listing fee offers an advantage. If you are a host who rents all year round, it would be better to opt for the one-time fee. You must ensure, though, that the bookings you receive will exceed the cost of the fee. If you only have active listings partly throughout the year, your best option is the fee per booking.
